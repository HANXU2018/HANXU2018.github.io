        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>guoqi<br>
😁My name is han xu.<br>
I am a student of hebei university in China.🇨🇳<br>
Is an information security sophomore undergraduate (as of May 2020📅).</p>
<p>I'm interested in the open source culture of the github community.<br>
In order to record my learning process, I started this blog.<br>
I like to use LeetCode for code practice every day.<br>
At present, I mainly study the background development knowledge of Java.<br>
I taught myself basic C++ syntax to learn data structures<br>
I have learned C language and python language in school courses and have a little understanding of js<br>
Currently studying database courses, MySQL is the database environment I am using.<br>
Participated in the small program cloud development evangelist activity held by tencent community, tried to develop a simple serverless WeChat small program.<br>
Currently, I use lenovo Y700P to run win10 for daily learning,<br>
but I am interested in the cool and free Linux desktop environment.<br>
I tried to install arch on ubuntu18.04 desktop but failed.<br>
Manjaro felt that it was suitable for me,<br>
but I finally gave up due to incompatible hardware conditions.<br>
In a word, I have tried a lot of computer technology,<br>
but I don't have a deep understanding of it,<br>
which is both my weakness and my strength.</p>
<p>I am curious about new technologies and interested in open source culture.<br>
I have been involved in programming for less than two years and my technical foundation is still very weak and there is still a long way to go.<br>
I look forward to seeing everyone here continue to learn with me and keep exploring and pursuing the future.<br>
This is the first time to write a blog in English.<br>
If you have any questions, please forgive me.<br>
Your correction is welcome.<br>
Now I'm learning the springboot framework to develop front and rear split web pages<br>
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions</p>
