<p>I would like to thank 🙏 the mentors jean-frederic Clere and George Zaronikas for allowing me to participate in the GSoC activities in 2020😁</p>
<h1 id="community-bonding">Community Bonding</h1>
<p>🍻 During Community Bonding, tutor jean-frederic Clere and I had six emails📧 to communicate with each other this week.<br>
It is a good exercise opportunity for me to see the outside world.<br>
It's been a great honor to work with some of the world's top technical mentors.<br>
I think my tutor is very interesting. 😃He not only can give me technical guidance, but also share the situation with me.<br>
For me, it was an all-round growth.👍</p>
<h1 id="schedule-planning">Schedule planning</h1>
<ul>
<li>My tutor suggested me to learn docker to understand and understand the knowledge related to containers.🐳<br>
I think it is a good choice to get to know it as soon as possible.🐋</li>
<li>At present, my main focus is on the course design of database.🐬</li>
<li>I'm trying to control git from the command line.I used git for version control before that.But that's all through the official GitHub visual interface. ☀️<br>
Although it can be used quickly and easily. And it meets my daily needs.<br>
But I think as a technician you still have to learn to use it in a more geeky way.🐵<br>
Not to show off, of course, but to be able to use more advanced features.<br>
And I will definitely use Git's command frequently in the following programming process.🏃<br>
It's My GitHub commit record .I've obviously been using it a lot more recently.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="this-weeks-summary">This week's summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>After learning that I was selected to CSoC, I spent a day to understand the requirements of this activity and how to proceed to the next step, trying to contact the tutor and other students from China.It's a very interesting thing.And I got to know a lot of good students from good universities.👬</li>
<li>I created a repository specifically for recording my learning code on a Chinese online programming site <a href="https://github.com/HANXU2018/shiyanlou">🔗Laboratory building learning records</a>
<ul>
<li>I can learn by coding on the server they provide.A learning log similar to the little green dot on GitHub will be generated.You can check the submission records of my warehouse to see what I have learned recently.</li>
<li>I will also learn the knowledge related to operation and maintenance such as k8s.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/huihe524/SpringbootVueDemo">📦SpringbootVueDemo</a>
<ul>
<li>This is the repository I created this afternoon for technology sharing in the school's in-house developer community.Springboot and Vue are techniques I've only recently learned.</li>
<li>I was the technical director of Java development in the school's developer community intelligent river(Because the name of our university is hebei because it is north of the Yellow River,he is River and bei is north in Chinese).</li>
<li>There will be regular technology sharing every weekend, leading junior students to learn.</li>
<li>👫Share your knowledge to improve yourself.No sooner had I learned it than I began to impart my knowledge.I think it's a great workout for me.</li>
<li>I'm also trying to run our community on GitHub and keep a record of every learning experience we share.I think it's great.✨</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/HANXU2018/WebSecurityCourseCode">📦web security Code warehouse </a>
<ul>
<li>I completed the experiment of the web security course and tried to upload it to Github warehouse for the first time to show others the internal learning records of my school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="end">end</h1>
<p>😁That's what I'm trying to do this week.I'm sure next week will be better.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>guoqi<br>
😁My name is han xu.<br>
I am a student of hebei university in China.🇨🇳<br>
Is an information security sophomore undergraduate (as of May 2020📅).</p>
<p>I'm interested in the open source culture of the github community.<br>
In order to record my learning process, I started this blog.<br>
I like to use LeetCode for code practice every day.<br>
At present, I mainly study the background development knowledge of Java.<br>
I taught myself basic C++ syntax to learn data structures<br>
I have learned C language and python language in school courses and have a little understanding of js<br>
Currently studying database courses, MySQL is the database environment I am using.<br>
Participated in the small program cloud development evangelist activity held by tencent community, tried to develop a simple serverless WeChat small program.<br>
Currently, I use lenovo Y700P to run win10 for daily learning,<br>
but I am interested in the cool and free Linux desktop environment.<br>
I tried to install arch on ubuntu18.04 desktop but failed.<br>
Manjaro felt that it was suitable for me,<br>
but I finally gave up due to incompatible hardware conditions.<br>
In a word, I have tried a lot of computer technology,<br>
but I don't have a deep understanding of it,<br>
which is both my weakness and my strength.</p>
<p>I am curious about new technologies and interested in open source culture.<br>
I have been involved in programming for less than two years and my technical foundation is still very weak and there is still a long way to go.<br>
I look forward to seeing everyone here continue to learn with me and keep exploring and pursuing the future.<br>
This is the first time to write a blog in English.<br>
If you have any questions, please forgive me.<br>
Your correction is welcome.<br>
Now I'm learning the springboot framework to develop front and rear split web pages<br>
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions</p>
